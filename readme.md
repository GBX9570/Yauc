# YAUC
Yet Another Unix Clone
* Pronounced Y-ow-k

### What is this?
Yauc is an operating system made alone by me (GBX9570) as a hobbyist project. I can't dedicate too much time to this, because I am still in school - however I will add features and fix bugs as much as possible. It is planned to be a Unix-like operating system with no standout features (at the time of writing).

**This is a *HOBBYIST* project! Do not expect professional quality in code, or frequent updates.**
